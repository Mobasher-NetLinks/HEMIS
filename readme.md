### Git commit message guidline

Types of commit messages:

 * **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, packages, npm)
 * **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: artisan commands)
 * **docs**: Documentation only changes
 * **feat**: A new feature
 * **fix**: A bug fix
 * **perf**: A code change that improves performance
 * **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
 * **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
 * **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

 What this guide effectively says is that, if your commit cannot be described sticking to this guideline, then thereâ€™s something wrong with the changes you have made i.e. you should not be committing the code without refining it, or the changes should be separated into multiple commits.
